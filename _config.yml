about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  For as long as I remember, I liked creating things. Whether it was a computer game when I was ten, a projection tool to display screens on water vapor when I was in junior high, or an hour-long feature film in high school, I enjoyed making them all.
  I studied Computer Engineering at the <mark>Sharif University of Technology</mark> with the goal of acquiring the skills needed for building impactful software. Also, I pursued numerous extracurricular activities like:
    - Contributing to <a href="ssc.ce.sharif.edu">SSC</a>, students' scientific chapter of computer engineering department as a central council member
    - Co-Founding an educational NGO, <a href="rastaiha.ir">Rasta</a>, writing its manifest, creating/presenting workshops at events, and managing its media and technical sections
    - Teaching different courses ranging from calculus and programming to creative writing at Iran's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents">Nodet</a> schools
    - Hosting and directing multiple episodes of podcasts and radio plays
  
#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
